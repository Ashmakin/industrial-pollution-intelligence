## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Test Database Connection
```bash
psql-17 -h localhost -p 5432 -U pollution_user -d pollution_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM water_quality_data;"
# Expected: 900
```

### Test API Health
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | python3 -m json.tool
# Expected: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### Test Data Quality
```bash
psql-17 -h localhost -p 5432 -U pollution_user -d pollution_db -c "SELECT station_name, COUNT(*) FROM water_quality_data GROUP BY station_name;"
# Expected: 5 stations with 180 records each
```
